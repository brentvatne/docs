# Expo

- ✅ You can use this library with [Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/development/introduction/). No config plugin is required.
- ❌ This library can't be used in the "Expo Go" app because it [requires custom native code](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/).

## Integration

**Prerequisites:** Using [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) or [Expo Router](https://expo.github.io/router/docs/)

1. Create an account [here](https://www.vexo.co/sign-up)
2. You'll be prompted into creating a new app, give it a cool name (you will be able to change that later) and once you submit it, you'll be given an API key.
3. Run `npx expo install vexo-analytics` in your project.
4. Generate the native projects by running `npx expo prebuild` and in the `index.js` add the following, eg:

```js
import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';
import App from './MyCoolApp';

// Vexo
import { vexo } from 'vexo-analytics';
vexo('YOUR_API_KEY');

registerRootComponent(App);
```

5. Run your app using `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android`.

**Wait, that's it?** Yes! That's it. With that ease of integration experience you get an incredible set of features, go check them out!

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout current="expo" next={{href: 'features', label: 'Supported features'}}>{children}</DocLayout>
