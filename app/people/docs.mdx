# People

It's important to see who are the users that have access to the data behind your application, and what type of access they have.
You can change the level of access for each team member at any point in time, if you have the required permissions for it.
There are three defined levels of access:
* __Owner:__ Only one person per app can be the owner, it refers to the person who created the app and has all privileges.
* __Write:__ Anyone can have write access if provided initially by the owner, and then they would be able to assign write access to anyone below them as well.
* __Read:__ They only have access to read the data from your application, no modifications allowed.
