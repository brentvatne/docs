# Real Time

### How it works

Real time is an excellent debugging tool. You can see what your users are doing in real time, if they experienced crashes, or some unexpected behavior.
It's a great way to validate that production releases are working as expected, and how your app behaves for users that are of your interest.
If your app has a freemium, and an enterprise customer is having trouble while uploading a document, you'll be able to easily debug it with this feature.

We define real time as a time window of 60 seconds from the time the last event happened. That means that if a user is interacting in any way with your app,
you will be able to see it's activity until it goes inactive.

**Note:** there's a time window between the event happening, processing ourselves and showing it.

<DocImage src="/docs/sessions.png" width="1018" height="440"/>

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout
    current="real-time"
    previous={{ href: 'sessions', label: 'Sessions'}}
    next={{ href: 'screens', label: 'Screens & Taps' }} >
        {children}
</DocLayout>
