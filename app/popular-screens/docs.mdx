# Popular Screens

### How it works

Watching your most popular screens will provide you with confidence about assumptions you've done on how your users are interacting with your app.

Popular screens is calculated by counting the amount of times a screen is visited by gathering the screen name using [React Navigation component](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/screen/).
For this count, we do not take in account any type of context, that is, we will count even if it's the same user visiting the N amount of times,
or different app versions from the same screen.

<DocImage src="/docs/popular-screens.png" width="502" height="392" smallImage/>

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout
    current="popular-screens"
    previous={{ href: 'version-adoption', label: 'Version Adoption'}}
    next={{ href: 'app-intensity', label: 'App Intensity' }} >
        {children}
</DocLayout>
