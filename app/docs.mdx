# Introduction to Vexo

Vexo is the first React Native out of the box tool for analytics.
We provide a solution for precise and actionable data with a seamless integration and zero-configuration, zero-coding support.

Our documentation is a great place to find most answers and make sure that your experience using Vexo is a magical one.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites**

- Using [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)

**Getting started**

1. Create an account [here](https://www.vexo.co/sign-up)
2. You'll be prompted into creating a new app, give it a cool name (you will be able to change that later) and once you submit it, you'll be given an API key.
3. Run `yarn add vexo-analytics` or `npm install vexo-analytics` in your project. `cd ios && pod install` is required for iOS as well.
4. You are just one line of code away! In your `index.js` add the following, eg:

```js
// index.js
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import { App } from './MyCoolApp';

// Vexo
import { vexo } from 'vexo-analytics';
vexo('YOUR_API_KEY');

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```

**Wait, that's it?** Yes! That's it. With that ease of integration experience you get an incredible set of features, go [check them out](https://www.vexo.co/docs/features)!
