# Drop off rate

### How it works

The rate at which users abandon your app provides further understanding about the enhancement that your users have with your app.

This metric is related to what is known as bounce rate in the web,
calculated as the percentage of users that only have one session for the current day, or the current time period and over all users that are active.

That means that if a user has interacted with your app only once and the time span is 28 days, this will be counted as drop off.
In the case where it has interacted twice or more, this will be counted as a user that hasn't dropped off.

In the future, the time span will be configurable so that you can specify what time span is appropriate.
