# Device Sessions

### How it works

As mentioned in [average-session metric](https://vexo.co/docs/average-sessions),
a session for a user is defined under the initial event of start using your app, and one of the closing events:
- They close the app
- They start browsing other apps
- They lock the screen

Contained under a session, we will track user actions and show them ordered by the time those events happened so that you can understand the sequence
under analysis. Sessions will be listed by device with valuable data added to further understand what is it that you are taking a look at,
such as the time a session took, the amount of events, the app version, the device model and more!

This feature is great to understand specific behavior from a user,
track down bugs from your application, and understand that users are following patterns when using your app.
